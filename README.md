| ![HTML5 & CSS3](https://i.imgur.com/3GMFsBI.png) HTML, CSS, SASS 	| I think it is more than obvious. Web development in general including front- and backend designing and programming along with system administration for server hosting purposes and hardening them to be always one step ahead of skids. In other words yeah I've done my homework regarding this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
| ![JavaScript](https://i.imgur.com/0OPRvXF.png) JavaScript      	| Mainly interested in client-sided fingerprinting techniques in browser, anti-fraud systems and algorithms and different [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) in general. I've also worked a lot with the server-sided JavaScript engine [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). |
|  PHP             	| Yes, I'd say I have a wide knownledge in this language. Ask me anything as I've done my homework during my freetime for years when it comes to PHP backend development _(considering I'm one hundred percent üéì self-taught volunteer)_    	|
| SQL             	| The basics of MySQL, advanced & more complex queries and optimizing them for maxium performance, securely optimizing queries for the maxium perfomance                                                                                                                                                 	|
| ![C](https://i.imgur.com/jFNBkOV.png) ![assembly programming](https://i.ibb.co/LJfy61B/asm.jpg) **C**/**++**           	| C/C++ fundamentals, C++11 standards, C++17 standards and best practices, proper memory allocation and deallocation, initializers and constructors, pointers, operators, Windows API fundamentals, memory manipulation and understanding its basics, understanding [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output), [Heap (memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) and their benefits along with possible risks, low level programming in C/++ & assembly x86, code protection and anti-cheating techniques, pseudocode, [Polymorphic coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code), base systems (hex, dec, bin. etc...), exploiting & hooking windows API functions, debugging and probelm solving 	|
| ![CSharp](https://i.imgur.com/harHKcH.png) C#              	|           Not really interested in this language at the moment. Althought, I've been playing around with .NET for ages.                                                                                                                                                                                                           	|
